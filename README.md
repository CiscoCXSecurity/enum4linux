# enum4linux
A Linux alternative to enum.exe for enumerating data from Windows and Samba hosts.

Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems. It attempts to offer similar functionality to enum.exe formerly available from www.bindview.com.

This is a fork from CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux addressing issues found on my personal use. It is also available at Portcullis Labs Research and Development (https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux/)
